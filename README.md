# Udacity-Courses-Work
A collection of some of my work from the various Udacity Classes I have done.
<b>NOTE: All of this work was done while working through each quiz/challenge in Udacity Courses.</b>

<H2>Course: Web Development:</H2> 
This was about designing Dynamic Web Applications using python and hosting them on google app engine. I hosted all of my work from following the course at http://udacitypaul.appspot.com/ I didn't pay much attention to the visual design becuase I just wanted to experiment with web development in Python. So its pretty messy.

<H2>Course: Developing Android Apps:</H2> 
This is my work as part of Udacity's intermediate Android. The Course Centres around developing a weather app which I wrote step by step as I followed the course. <b>Note: I studied this course to learn to develop apps for android which were better designed so I worked very closely to the content of the course and so my app is nearly identical to the one developed by the instructor of the course.</b>
