# Udacity-Courses-Work
A collection of some of my work from the various Udacity Classes I have done.
NOTE:All of this work was done while working through each quiz/challenge in Udacity Courses 

<H2>Course: Web Development:</H2> 
This was about designing Dynamic Web Applications using python and hosting them on google app engine. I hosted all of my work from following the course at 
    http://udacitypaul.appspot.com/ I didn't pay much attention to the visual design becuase I just wanted to experiment with web development in Python. So its pretty messy.
